## Machine Learning
- This all assignment done by me for my graduate machine learning course. In all assignments, I have not used any library to train my model. Instead of that I only wrote code for all the models.
- First assignment is to choose my data and visualize it.
- Then, next two are classification and regression assignment.
- Followed by reinforcement learning assignment in which I also wrote code to beat computer in playing Blackjack.
- Lat assignment was deep learning in which I used keras library.
